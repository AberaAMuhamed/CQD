# CQD - The Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE): Dynamics of solitons and vortices
The GPE is a mean field equation that has been incredibly successful in describing the dynamics
of Bose Einstein condensates (BECs). The equation features a non-linear term and thus allows for
stable soliton solutions in 1D and additional topological defects such as vortices in 2D. The goal of
this project is to study these phenomena using the split-step Fourier method.
